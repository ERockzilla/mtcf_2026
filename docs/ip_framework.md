# Rockrun IP Framework: Strategic Intellectual Property Management for Competitive Medical Device Innovation

## Executive Summary

This document establishes the Intellectual Property (IP) framework for the MedTech Cognitive Foundry (MTCF) platform. Medical device innovation requires careful balance between sponsor Freedom to Operate (FTO) for FDA approval and creator rights to retain underlying tools and methodologies.

The framework implements a **Tiered Challenge Model** where Sponsors select IP terms before challenge launch, and Creators agree by participating.

---

## 1. The Rockrun IP Tiers (Selectable by Sponsor)

When a Sponsor creates a challenge, they must select one of three IP modes. This sets clear expectations for Creators immediately.

### Mode A: Total Transfer ("Commercialization" Tier)

**Best for:** Specific component designs, CAD files, or software modules where the Sponsor intends to manufacture and sell the result.

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **The Deal** | In exchange for the cash prize, the Winning Creator assigns 100% ownership of the IP to the Sponsor. |
| **Sponsor Benefit** | Full Freedom to Operate (FTO). They can file patents, modify the design, and submit to the FDA without seeking further permission. |
| **Creator Benefit** | High cash prize (premium payout required). |
| **Prize Multiplier** | 2.0x base rate |

**Crucial Clause — Background IP Exception:**
> If the creator uses their own pre-existing tools (e.g., a proprietary AI model, custom libraries, or methodologies) to generate the result, they retain ownership of the tool but grant the Sponsor a perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free license to use the output generated by that tool.

---

### Mode B: Non-Exclusive License ("Ideation" Tier)

**Best for:** Early-stage concepts, "Blue Sky" problem solving, or finding new clinical indications for existing technology.

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **The Deal** | The Creator retains ownership of the IP. The Sponsor receives a broad, royalty-free, non-exclusive license to use the idea. |
| **Sponsor Benefit** | Lower prize cost; access to many diverse ideas without the legal burden of owning them all. |
| **Creator Benefit** | They can resell the underlying concept to other non-competing industries or use it for their own portfolio. |
| **Prize Multiplier** | 1.0x base rate |

**Key Terms:**
- Non-exclusive: Sponsor cannot prevent creator from licensing to others
- Field-of-use restrictions may apply (e.g., "Medical devices only")
- Creator retains right to publish after 6-month embargo period

---

### Mode C: The Option Model ("Startup" Tier)

**Best for:** Complex systems or novel therapies where the solution might become a standalone startup or requires ongoing development.

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **The Deal** | The Prize buys the Sponsor an Exclusive Option Period (default: 6 months) to negotiate a purchase or royalty license. |
| **Sponsor Benefit** | They get a "first look" without committing to full purchase immediately. Can evaluate regulatory pathway before major investment. |
| **Creator Benefit** | Potential for a much larger payout (royalties/equity) if the idea succeeds, rather than a one-time cash prize. |
| **Prize Multiplier** | 0.5x base rate (Option Fee) + negotiated payout on exercise |

**Option Terms:**
- Option Period: 6 months (extendable to 12 months at 25% additional fee)
- During Option Period: Creator cannot license to competing entities
- If Option lapses: Creator has full rights, including to competing sponsors

## 2. Generative Innovation & AI Provenance

The platform utilizes "generative innovation" (AI-assisted development), creating unique IP considerations.

### 2.1 The Provenance & Tooling Declaration

**Mandatory Disclosure:** All submissions must include a "Tooling Declaration" form.

Creators must declare:
- [ ] **No AI Assistance** — Solution developed without generative AI tools
- [ ] **AI-Assisted** — Used AI tools with significant human guidance and modification
- [ ] **AI-Generated** — Substantial portions generated by AI with minimal human modification

### 2.2 The "Clean Room" Rule

Creators must specifically declare if they used:
- Large Language Models (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.)
- Code Assistants (GitHub Copilot, Cursor, etc.)
- Image Generators (Midjourney, DALL-E, Stable Diffusion)
- Domain-Specific AI (Med-PaLM, MONAI, etc.)

### 2.3 Why This Matters

The US Copyright Office and Patent Office currently have strict limits on AI-generated works:
- **Copyright:** AI-generated content without human authorship may not be copyrightable
- **Patents:** Inventorship requires a natural person; AI cannot be an inventor

**Creator Warranty:** By submitting, Creators warrant that there was "significant human creative direction and judgment" involved in the solution, OR the submission is flagged as "AI-Generated Content" with reduced IP strength.

### 2.4 IP Strength Implications

| Declaration | Patent Eligibility | Copyright Eligibility | Prize Adjustment |
|-------------|-------------------|----------------------|------------------|
| No AI | Full | Full | 100% |
| AI-Assisted | Full (with documentation) | Full | 100% |
| AI-Generated | Limited/Questionable | Limited/Questionable | 50% |

## 3. Platform Architecture for IP Safety

### 3.1 The "Black Box" Submission Phase

During the active competition:
- Submissions are viewable **only** by the Sponsor and designated Judges
- Full technical specifications are **not** visible to other Creators
- This prevents "IP contamination" where Creator B accidentally copies Creator A

**Post-Competition:**
- After winner announcement, non-winning solutions remain confidential for 90 days
- Winner's solution visibility is determined by Sponsor preference

### 3.2 Background IP Disclosure Form

Before uploading any submission file, Creators must complete:

> **Third-Party IP Disclosure**
> 
> Does this submission contain any:
> - [ ] University patents or inventions (subject to institution IP policies)
> - [ ] Open source code (list licenses: GPL, MIT, Apache, etc.)
> - [ ] Former employer proprietary information
> - [ ] Licensed third-party components
> - [ ] Government-funded research subject to Bayh-Dole Act
>
> If YES to any, provide details: _______________

**Purpose:** Protects Sponsor from unknowingly infringing on existing patents or violating license terms.

### 3.3 The "Runner-Up" Acquisition Clause

Often, 2nd or 3rd place solutions are also valuable. The standard terms include:

> **Runner-Up Acquisition Rights**
> 
> For 90 days following the competition, the Sponsor has the right to acquire IP rights to any non-winning submission for:
> - **Mode A challenges:** 20% of the main prize
> - **Mode B challenges:** 10% of the main prize  
> - **Mode C challenges:** Separate Option agreement required

## 4. Stakeholder Protection Matrix

| Stakeholder | Primary Fear | Rockrun Solution |
|-------------|--------------|------------------|
| **Sponsor** | "I pay for a solution but get sued later because the Creator stole it or didn't own it." | **Indemnification Clause:** Creator warrants originality and clean title. **Total Transfer:** Clear contract transferring rights upon payment. **Background IP Disclosure:** Known encumbrances documented upfront. |
| **Creator** | "I solve a billion-dollar problem and only get $5k, and they take my other ideas too." | **Scope Limitation:** IP transfer applies only to the winning solution, not the creator's background tools or methodologies. **Tiered Options:** High-value problems = High prize tiers. **Option Model:** Participate in upside potential. |
| **Rockrun** | "We get caught in the middle of a patent dispute." | **Pass-Through Liability:** Terms of Service clearly state Rockrun is a facilitator, not the IP owner. **Escrow:** Prize funds held until IP transfer documentation complete. **Arbitration Clause:** Disputes resolved through binding arbitration. |

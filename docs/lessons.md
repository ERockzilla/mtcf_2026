# Lessons Learned & Risk Mitigation Strategies

## 1. Competitive Dynamics (The "Yankees Problem")
*   **Risk**: If winning teams accumulate infinite advantages (more GPU, memory), the competition becomes predictable and boring.
*   **Mitigation Strategy**: The **Season Model**.
    *   **Accumulation**: Advantages persist for 3 months.
    *   **Reset**: All hardware advantages reset after the Season Championship, while Reputation scores persist.

## 2. Regulatory Compliance
*   **Risk**: Pre-approval promotion violations during live streams.
*   **Mitigation**:
    *   **Labeling**: All outputs strictly labeled "Investigational Prototype."
    *   **Disclaimer**: Explicit prohibition of safety/efficacy claims during the broadcast.
    *   **Oversight**: "Regulatory Architect" on the Steering Committee has veto power.

## 3. Intellectual Property (IP) Usage
*   **Risk**: Orphaned IP from hackathons/sprints.
*   **Mitigation**:
    *   **Rentable Teams**: Teams are hired as units to continue development.
    *   **Tiered Assignment**: Winning IP goes to Sponsor; non-winning IP enters a "Commons" or secondary market to prevent hoarding.

## 4. Data Privacy
*   **Risk**: PHI leakage during public broadcasts.
*   **Mitigation**:
    *   **Synthetic Data Only**: Live stream uses only high-fidelity synthetic data.
    *   **VDI Enclave**: Real-world validation (if any) happens in a secure, non-broadcast environment.
